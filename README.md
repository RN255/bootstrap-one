## Project Name: HelloCaf√© (Bootstrap)
This is a website landing that gives an overview of a new coffee product. There are plenty of photos, a description of the coffee, some questions and answers, a section to meet the experts, and a chance to sign up to an email list.

## Motivation
I wanted to develop an understanding of Bootstrap.

## Tech used
- Bootstrap

## Project features
- large full screen photo carousel
- visually pleasing design
- fully responsive design
- newsletter sign up modal pop up
- Q&A accordian

## Lessons learnt
- How to create web pages using bootstrap
- I don't think I would want to create whole pages using bootstrap, but it could certainly but used in sections as a supplement.

## Future development

- default Bootstrap colors could be customised.
